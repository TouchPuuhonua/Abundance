*** Voting versus Consensus: Features Comparison and Variations

See Sources section below.

*First introductory paragraph* /from original source/

As you begin working with new partners, it’s important to consider how
you will make decisions—from the big resolutions to the ordinary,
everyday choices. Who has the ultimate decision-making authority for
the team? Will members be involved in making all decisions, or only
some of them? Will the majority rule, or will all decisions require
unanimous support?

*Features List* /modified/
- inspired by original table
- informed by a somewhat different understanding of Consensus Process

 Voting Description
- Majority determines decisions
  - Must define “majority” first!
Consensus Description
- All partners may voice a position.
- All agree to support final decision,
  - even when not favorite choice!

Voting Advantages
- Familiar, conventional.
- Always produces a result.
Consensus Advantages
- Buy-in of/by all members.
- All perspectives included.
- Creative cooperation towards best decision.

Voting Disadvantages
- Minority viewpoints sidelined.
- Less creative interaction.
- Creates winners and losers.
Consensus Disadvantages
- Requires group commitment & experience.
- May require expert facilitator.
  - Otherwise may be tedious or even fail.

Voting Variations
- Plurality :: A large block of members supports a given decision.
- Range Voting: Each member scores each option, option with the
  highest average score wins.
Consensus Variations
- Fist-to-Five :: Team members use specific hand signals to
  - fist :: block consensus
  - one finger :: suggest changes
  - two fingers :: discuss minor issues
  - three fingers :: pass without discussion
  - four fingers :: affirm the decision
  - five fingers ::volunteer to take lead in implementing new decision
- Red/Yellow/Green Colored Cards
  - red card :: indicates opposition to decision
  - yellow card :: indicates reservations
  - green card :: signifies consent

Voting Considerations
- Group may need to decide which individuals are
“voting” members (e.g., based on length of
participation, attendance at a minimum number
of meetings).

Consensus Considerations
- How experienced is the group?
- What facilitator skills will be needed?
- What visual aids might help keep things clear?
- Are the issues relevant for everyone?
  - Consider delegating issues to smaller groups.
  - This leads towards Sociocracy.
