* Modified Consensus Process

I have significant training in and experience of using a group decision making
process called /Modified Consensus Process/. I will attempt to clarify the nature
and operation of this process and also make sure that it is not confused with
any other process which might happen to use the same name.

I have come to understand that there are serious flaws with
- traditional democratic processes
- strict "anyone may indefinitely block" consensus processes

/Modified Consensus Process/ seems to work very well for decision making by
groups of up to approximately 100 people who are
- fairly well acquainted with one another
- aligned in their fundamental values

Larger and less cohesive groups might want to explore the more sophisticated
process called /Sociocracy/.

** Objectives, Principles, Context

The objectives of /Modified Consensus Process/ are
1. To make better decisions by harnessing the intelligence of all participants,
   especially those who have differing viewpoints.
2. To have everyone in the community, especially all leaders and prospective
   leaders, trust one another as partners and allies and continue to contribute
   their time and energy towards our goals and vision.

/Modified Consensus Process/ is always operating as a powerful background
context, promoting civil and win-win approaches to decision making. We invoke
its methods explicitly when we need to make a decision and we have very
different ideas of what would be best.

While we may sometimes seem to have incompatible strategies and proposals, we
agree to trust one another and understand that
- everyone is seeing a valuable piece of the puzzle
- our values and commitments are fundamentally aligned
- when we are attached to our positions, we become stupid
- when we get /on the same side of the table/
      - we get smarter
      - we are likely to find a better solution
            - one which satisfies everyone's concerns
            - and is /not/ a mere /compromise/

/Modified Consensus Process/ is faster and/or better than an Oppositional,
Competitive Process. Why? Because while /any/ process will sometimes bog down,
Consensus Process
- produces better decisions because of better understanding
- does not produce collateral damage:
      - it does not leave a dissatisfied, resentful minority

Both as a process and as a background context, /Modified Consensus Process/
helps protect our values, vision, goals and enterprises from being destroyed by
clever authoritarians using rhetoric and other win-lose takeover strategies.

** How It Works

*** The Agreements Behind the Process

We commit /to listen/ to everyone's viewpoint
- what they're saying
- where they're coming from
- their fundamental concerns
        
We commit /to understand/ everyone's viewpoint
- to /their/ satisfaction
- listening to be educated and enlightened
      - to have our understanding of the matter expanded
- taking 100% - 100% responsibility in the matter

We commit /to effectively communicate/ our viewpoints
      - trusting in the intention of our listeners
      - avoiding being long-winded or unclear
      - working iteratively until we are understood
      - taking 100% - 100% responsibility in the matter

Everyone engages in finding/creating a solution which
- addresses everyone's concerns and needs
- may possibly borrow /elements/ from anyone's ideas
even though it 
- may not be what we previously thought was best or good
- may not be any of the ideas proposed so far

We have a fallback democratic mechanism should consensus fail and we agree to
consider that to be a /nuclear option/ which may undermine our partnership and
should not be part of any political win-lose strategy.

*** The Regular Consensus Process

- Proposals are made
- Questions are asked
- Objections may be made
- Friendly amendments may be proposed and accepted or rejected
- Alternative proposals may be introduced
- Proposals may be withdrawn
- Straw polls can be taken for
      1. Do you think this proposal is on the right track?
      2. Do you think there are any serious flaws in this proposal?
      3. Do you think this proposal is complete and acceptable?
- If there are no objections, a proposal can be passed by acclamation
- If there are objections then
      - Discussion can continue if
            - there's sufficient time
            - such discussion is being productive
                  - e.g. people are learning
      - A proposal can be postponed
            - It can be referred to offline study by
                  - an existing working group
                  - an appointed sub-group
                  - appropriate subject experts
            - and then brought up again

It is /always everyone's job/ to assist in /keeping all concerns alive/ in the
conversation and assisting with /everyone being heard/.

If anyone is exhausting the ability of the gathering to maintain their
attention, especially by being long-winded or repetitious, the moderator or a
member of the group should politely interrupt them on this basis. (The /Mankind
Project/ uses the plea: "Have Mercy"!) In such a case the person speaking should
stop. They might request someone to provide "active listening" of their points
and then they should stand down. They can always take the floor again later if
they feel that an important point they were trying to express has been missed.

*** The Time-Limited Consensus Process

When a decision on an issue must be made before a deadline
- Get consensus on a time plan for making the decisions
- Including sufficient time for iteration on any proposals
- Same as the fast process, just condensed
- Everyone agreeing in advance to be satisfied with
      - Any safe and affordable solution
      - /Sociocracy Principle:/ "Is it safe? Can we try it?"

*** The Fallback Process: Voting

Should any party consider that
- Consensus Process has broken down
- Making a prompt decision is vital
They may call for a =Vote= to decide a matter

A /preliminary vote/ must first be taken to
- set aside Consensus Process
- for this specific matter

Any vote must achieve a a supermajority to pass
- 80% is the default supermajority
- a different level could have been agreed to
- in advance and
- for this clearly distinguished arena of issues

The Process
- =Person P= calls for a =Vote= on the proposal(s)
- The =Moderator= does a /straw poll/ to see if there's sufficient agreement for
  such a =Vote=
- =Person P= might withdraw their call
Otherwise
- The proposals on the table are briefly stated by their proponents
- The proposed voting method is stated by =Person P=, e.g.
      - voting methods and options must already be well understood
      - will friendly amendments be entertained?
      - will any further questions be entertained?
      - is it preference voting or something else?
      - etc.
- We take the initial vote on
      - setting aside Consensus Process
      - for this specific matter
- The vote may fail to get a supermajority
Otherwise
- We engage in any allowed discussion
- We hold the agreed =Vote=
- If the =Vote= achieves a supermajority the issue is decided
      - with all of the potential flaws of the democratic process

** Creative Consensus and Commitments

It is unacceptable to
- Block consensus on a proposal as a strategy to get one's way
- Agree or /go along/ when it seems to us that
      - a proposal truly does not meet an important need
      - issues and criticism have not been sufficiently understood
- Try to game the system with any win-lose methods

When =Person P= is aware that
- any proposal they would prefer /will not/ achieve consensus
- their objectives /have been understood/
and there is a proposal on the table
- which could achieve consensus
- is not antithetical to any important need
then =Person P= agrees to yield their position by either
- joining with the possible consensus
- abstaining from blocking the consensus

Most of us have practiced strategies for /getting our way/. Most of us have had
reason to fear the intentions of others and to fear /losing/. When we're in a
group of colleagues we could potentially trust we tend to automatically use our
familiar win-lose strategies which undermine trust. In order to benefit from
/Modified Consensus Process/ we must retrain ourselves and our colleagues in
win-win strategies and commit to a context of trust.
