* Abundance Musings

This is just a place to put things that occur to me that might relate to Abundance.

This is an incubator for musings that might develop into useful pieces elsewhere.

** Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Reward

- Drive video

- Learning
- Athletics

** Having a great life

- NVC
- Maslov
 
** Autonomy

Living spaces designed for comfort, efficiency, sustainability.
- always possible
- even easier with modern techniques
- yet somehow scarce and expensive!

We've known how to make nice houses and living spaces for thousands of years.
- For Harsh Climates
      - Thatching and living roofs
      - Roman central heating
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_bed-stove][Chinese heated beds]]
      - Earth-sheltered buildings
- For warm climates and seasons
      - Lanais
- For all climates
      - Orienting towards the sun
      - Strategic Planting of foliage

Modern innovations make it even easier
  - Excellent, inexpensive insulation
  - Double and triple glazing
  - Screens for windows and lanais

Dominators want nice living space to be
- variable quality based on status
      - signaling status
      - external motivation for "playing the game"
- high initial and maintenance costs
      - signaling wealth
- requiring high external inputs
      - which are rent seeking
            - centrally controlled
            - ongoingly expensive
      - for
            - energy
            - water
            - sewerage
            - trash removal

Ancient and modern techniques allow for greater autonomy
- Using water more than once
      - Washing Water becomes irrigation

** Having a great life

** My life in order
   
Having my life in order allows for
- ease of being, happiness, low stress
- easier to make myself available
      - spontaneity
      - reliability
- well-being
      - my health in order
            - exercise
            - nutrition
            - medical care
- finances
      - more frugal
      - seizing opportunities

Having my life in disorder 
- feeds my rackets!
