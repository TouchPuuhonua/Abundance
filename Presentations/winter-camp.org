* Abundance Culture
- A Workshop for Winter Camp 2026

** What this presentation promises you
  - More clarity about the source and essence of New Culture
  - The ability to clearly distinguish New Culture from Default Culture
    - Which allows you to recognize
      - Who your allies are, despite superficial differences
      - Any unwanted Default Culture contamination!
        - and what you can do about it!

** A Few Windows into My Background
- /There's too much here, cut it down./
- I've lived in a series of small Intentional Communities for 50 years
  - Surrounded by and overlapping with other experimental communities
- I'm A Deviant!
  - I'm on the Autistic Spectrum :: Intellectually but not socially gifted
  - I'm Queer :: Non-Binary and Gray-Sexual
  - My deviance partially immunized me from being infected by The
    Default Culture
  - And I had to work hard for many years to develop my Social Intelligence.
- I deeply love people
  - I care about what's possible for each of us and for all of us!
- I also have a fierce passion and need to understand things at the
  deepest possible level

** I Got Lucky
- As a child I was exposed to /Hippie Culture/ and read a lot of Utopian Fiction
  - Including Heinlein's /Stranger In A Strange Land/
  - These things resonated with me but I didn't know how to actualize any of them
  - And /Hippie Culture/ seemed to disappear by the time I came of age
- When I was in college, I was in an Intentional Community
  - We all did the /est Training/
  - I discovered that I was close-minded and arrogant!
  - Oops!  I needed to fix that!
  - Fortunately, I had a community to help me!
- I started attending New Culture Summer Camp
  - I unlearned so much shame!
  - I learned so many community skills!
    - Especially Consensus Process!
    - I now teach and consult practical Consensus Process!
- I did the the Human Awareness Institute Workshops
  - and became a HAI Intern
  - which got me massive training in
    - service, open-heartedness, empathy
- I learned about NVC
  - Which I practice every day
  - and I've facilitated many NVC study groups
- At BurningMan
  - I'm a BurningMan Ranger
    - More extraordinary Training & Practice
  - I'm a founding member of Poly Paradise Village
      - Where I run The Human Carcass Wash

How Lucky can a Queer Aspie get?

** Awesomeness and Dissonance!

My life in Alternative Cultures was highly dissonant with my life in
Default Culture.  I knew from my experience that people and cultures
can transform, but how?  Enrolling Default Culture folks in
transformational workshops was helpful, but few people shifted very
much.  They didn't become real allies.

As an Aspie this was especially painful.
- I needed to understand what was going on at a deeper level!

I looked for clues!
- Psychology?  Eastern Religion?  Advanced est workshops?  HAI?
  - All helpful but NOT SUFFICIENT!

** Discovering Riane Eisler

When I was at a Body Electric Workshop I was given a copy of Riane
Eisler's wordy book /Sacred Pleasure/.

Riane Eisler recognizes two fundamental and natural organizing
principles of Human Societies
- Partnership Culture
  - the foundation of all of our beautiful alternative cultures
- Dominator Culture
  - the antithetical element in Default Culture

This was the clue, but for a Geek this wasn't quite enough!
- Most binaries are false!
- Why should this one be any different?

** Enter Game Theory!

There are two fundamental kinds of interactions
- Win-Win :: That's Partnership
- Win-Lose :: That's Dominator

Everything Game Theory tells us about these kinds of interactions
lines up with Riane Eisler's models!

** But wait, there's more!

What motivates and maintains
- Win-Win interactions and Partnership Culture?
- Win-Lose interactions and Dominator Culture?

*** Two Contexts: Abundance vs. Scarcity

By Abundance I don't mean /having lots of stuff/
- It's a background context that's possible regardless of whether one
  is rich or poor.

And Scarcity can take many forms!

- Present the Parable of :: [[file:abundance-vs-scarcity-parable.org][Robin and Chris]]
- Questions:
  - Which of them is coming from Abundance?
  - Which of them is coming from Scarcity?
  - Who is using up wealth?
  - Who is generating wealth?
  - Where is there Dominance?
  - Where is there Partnership?

Question:
- Why is BDSM Play actually Partnership despite appearances?
  - Answer :: consent + a clear beginning & end
- The same goes for all friendly games, e.g. chess, wrestling, etc.

What if you count wins and losses and hold it over people afterwards?

*** Group Exercises

Have them get into groups of 4-6 people.

Pass out the [[file:abundance-vs-scarcity.org][Abundance vs. Scarcity Flyer]]

Go over it /very briefly/!

Group Directions
- Divide your group into Dominators & Partners!
- Don't worry, you'll be switching later!

Discuss how you'd handle the following scenarios:

**** Scenario 1:
- You're living in a remote region of the world without affordable
  trade.
- The harvest has failed - it won't provide enough food for everyone
  for the winter!
- This was foreseeable and you've made preparations.
- What preparations did you do?
- What will you do now?

SWITCH!

**** Scenario 2:
- Sustainable mostly-automated factories can now produce enough of all
  necessary goods that people need for their basic well-being and
  comfort with few workers needed.
- Sustainable agriculture has advanced similarly.
- Are these welcome developments?
- Despite the cheapness of these essentials, how will you afford to
  buy what you need?
- What would make you wealthy in this kind of economy?
- Is prosperity the same as wealth?
- What is wealth?
- What is a post-scarcity society?

SWITCH!

**** Scenario 3:
- After many years of universal peace and prosperity
- A disaster has befallen the whole world!
- Choose from:
  - Plague, Climate Collapse, Major asteroid strike
  - or something else if you prefer.
- Oh, and some other countries / groups are planning on surviving by
  taking your resources by force!
- You have long known that nature provides no long-term guarantees!
- How have you prepared?
- How will you now handle this?

Summary:

Liberals And Conservatives Build Morality On Different Foundations

Political beliefs grow from deep psychological roots, shaped by five
key moral values:
- harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity.
- Touch: Harm can be generalized to Consequentialism

Research from more than 23,000 Americans shows liberals focus mainly
on harm and fairness, while conservatives draw from all five moral
foundations. These differences create powerful team mindsets that can
block understanding. Real progress begins when people recognize the
moral logic driving those they disagree with.

- Liberals tend to prioritize care and fairness above other moral concerns.
- Conservatives value loyalty, authority, and purity alongside care and fairness.
- Shared team values can shut down open-minded thinking and deepen divides.
- Moral humility helps people step outside the 'Matrix' of self-righteous certainty.
- Ancient wisdom and psychology both suggest balance between change and stability.

*** Fictional Utopias

Fictional Utopias can be a powerful way of exploring what might be
possible in a new group, community or society.

- Robert Heinlein: Stranger in a Strange Land
