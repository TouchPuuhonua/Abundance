* Abundance Culture
- A Workshop for Winter Camp 2026

** This workshop is designed for
  - Clarity about the source and essence of New Culture
  - Clearly distinguishing New Culture from Default Culture
  - Identifying our allies, despite superficial differences
  - Gently addressing Default Culture Contamination in ourselves and others!

I use the Burning Man term /Default Culture/ for the mainstream
culture of America.  I like the term because it's non-judgmental.
We'll learn more about it's nature in a few minutes!

** Some Windows into My Background
- I've lived in small Intentional Communities for 50 years
  - Surrounded by and overlapping with other experimental communities
- I'm A Deviant! *Any other deviants here?* [Raising my hand and looking around]
  - My particulars:
    - I'm on the Autistic Spectrum :: Intellectually but not socially gifted!
      - What some people call an *Aspie*
    - I'm Queer :: Non-Binary and Gray-Sexual!
  - My deviance partially immunized me from being infected by The
    Default Culture - Yay, a win!
  - I had to work hard for many years to develop my Social Intelligence!
    - It was worth it!
- I deeply love people
  - I care about what's possible for each of us and for all of us!
- I also have a fierce passion and need to understand things at the
  deepest possible level!

** I Got Lucky
- As a child I avidly followed the /Hippie Movement/ and read a lot of
  Utopian Fiction
  - Including Heinlein's /Stranger In A Strange Land/ - *Any fans?*
  - These things strongly resonated with me but I didn't know how to
    actualize any of them!
  - The /Hippie Movement/ seemed to disappear by the time I came of
    age :-(
- I lived in an Intentional Community when I was in college
  - We all did the /est Training/ where
  - I discovered that I was close-minded and arrogant!
  - Oops!  I needed to fix that!
  - Fortunately, I had a community to help me!
- *Fast forward some years:*
- I started attending New Culture Summer Camp
  - I unlearned so much shame!
  - I learned so many community skills!
    - Especially Consensus Process!
    - I now teach and consult practical Consensus Process!
- I did the Human Awareness Institute Workshops
  - and became a HAI Intern
  - which got me massive training in
    - service, open-heartedness, empathy and more
- I learned NVC
  - Which I practice every day
  - and I've facilitated many NVC study groups
- I discovered BurningMan, where
  - I'm a BurningMan Ranger
    - Providing more extraordinary Training & Practice
  - And I'm a founding member of Poly Paradise Village
    - Where I run The Human Carcass Wash!

*How Lucky can a Queer Aspie get?*

*Does anyone else feel like you've been privileged to find awesome
cultural alternatives?*

** Awesomeness and Dissonance!

My life in Alternative Cultures was highly dissonant with my life in
Default Culture.  I knew from my experience that people and cultures
can transform, but how?  Enrolling Default Culture folks in
transformational workshops was helpful, but they were almost always
still rooted in /Default Culture/.

As an Aspie this was especially painful.
- I needed to understand what was going on at a deeper level!
- What's the gap between /Default Culture/ and the seemingly *much
  better* /New Culture/?

I looked for clues!
- Psychology?  Eastern Religion?  Advanced est, Landmark & HAI workshops?
  - All helpful but NOT SUFFICIENT!

** Discovering Riane Eisler

At a Body Electric Workshop at Wildwood near Christmas time we had a
gift exchange.  I got a copy of Riane Eisler's book /Sacred Pleasure/
from Colin Brown, the then owner of Body Electric School.

Reading /Sacred Pleasure/ opened my eyes!

Riane Eisler recognizes two fundamental and natural ways that
Human Societies tend to be structured
- Partnership Culture
  - the foundation of all of our beautiful alternative cultures
- Dominator Culture
  - the antithetical element in Default Culture
She dissected them, showed the forms they can take, what feeds them
and more.

This was the big clue, but for a Geek this wasn't quite enough!
- Most binaries are false!
- Why should this one be any different?

** Enter Game Theory!

There are two fundamental kinds of interactions
- Win-Win :: That's Partnership
- Win-Lose :: That's Dominator

Everything Game Theory tells us about these kinds of interactions
lines up with Riane Eisler's models!  And it explains the binary.

** But wait, there's more!

What context motivates and maintains
- Win-Win interactions and Partnership Culture?
- Win-Lose interactions and Dominator Culture?

*** Two Contexts: Abundance vs. Scarcity

By Abundance I don't mean /having lots of stuff/
- It's a background context that's possible regardless of whether one
  is rich or poor.

And Scarcity can take many forms!

- Present the Parable of :: [[file:abundance-vs-scarcity-parable.org][Robin and Chris]]
- Questions:
  - Which of them is coming from Abundance?
  - Which of them is coming from Scarcity?
  - Who is using up wealth?
  - Who is generating wealth?
  - Where is there Dominance?
  - Where is there Partnership?

Question:
- Why is BDSM Play actually Partnership despite appearances?
  - Answer :: consent + a clear beginning & end
- The same goes for all friendly games, e.g. chess, wrestling, etc.

What if you count wins and losses and hold it over people afterwards?

*** Group Exercises

Have them get into groups of 4-6 people.

Pass out the [[file:abundance-vs-scarcity.org][Abundance vs. Scarcity Flyer]]

Go over it /very briefly/!

Group Directions
- Divide your group into Dominators & Partners!
- Don't worry, you'll be switching later!

Discuss how you'd handle the following scenarios:

**** Scenario 1:
- You're living in a remote region of the world without affordable
  trade.
- The harvest has failed - it won't provide enough food for everyone
  for the winter!
- This was foreseeable and you've made preparations.
- What preparations did you do?
- What will you do now?

SWITCH!

**** Scenario 2:
- Sustainable mostly-automated factories can now produce enough of all
  necessary goods that people need for their basic well-being and
  comfort with few workers needed.
- Sustainable agriculture has advanced similarly.
- Are these welcome developments?
- Despite the cheapness of these essentials, how will you afford to
  buy what you need?
- What would make you wealthy in this kind of economy?
- Is prosperity the same as wealth?
- What is wealth?
- What is a post-scarcity society?

SWITCH!

**** Scenario 3:
- After many years of universal peace and prosperity
- A disaster has befallen the whole world!
- Choose from:
  - Plague, Climate Collapse, Major asteroid strike
  - or something else if you prefer.
- Oh, and some other countries / groups are planning on surviving by
  taking your resources by force!
- You have long known that nature provides no long-term guarantees!
- How have you prepared?
- How will you now handle this?

*** One More Piece: Culture Wars

Present Capsule of Jonathan Haidt's work

**** The Moral Matrix

2. Fairness/Reciprocity [L&C]
3. In-group/Loyalty [C]
   - "Sports is to War as Pornography is to Sex"
4. Authority/Respect [C]

Summary:

Liberals And Conservatives Build Morality On Different Foundations

Political beliefs grow from deep psychological roots, shaped by five
key moral values:
- harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity.
- Touch: Harm can be generalized to Consequentialism

Research from more than 23,000 Americans shows liberals focus mainly
on harm and fairness, while conservatives draw from all five moral
foundations. These differences create powerful team mindsets that can
block understanding. Real progress begins when people recognize the
moral logic driving those they disagree with.

- Liberals tend to prioritize care and fairness above other moral concerns.
- Conservatives value loyalty, authority, and purity alongside care and fairness.
- Shared team values can shut down open-minded thinking and deepen divides.
- Moral humility helps people step outside the 'Matrix' of self-righteous certainty.
- Ancient wisdom and psychology both suggest balance between change and stability.

*** Fictional Utopias

Fictional Utopias can be a powerful way of exploring what might be
possible in a new group, community or society.

- Robert Heinlein: Stranger in a Strange Land
- Ursula LeGuin: The Dispossessed
