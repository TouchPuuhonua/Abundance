* Summing it up: Key Distinctions of Abundance

- Radical Acceptance :: Accepting and including people without judgment.
Accepting people exactly the way they are and accepting that
they're not what they're not. It's important to understand that
this acceptance does not inhibit people's growth into what's
next for them -- in fact it tends to accelerate it!

- Unlimited Growth And Development :: There are no fixed limits
  to human growth and development, neither individually nor
  socially.

- Win-Win :: Interactions are designed to benefit everyone
  directly or indirectly affected by them.
