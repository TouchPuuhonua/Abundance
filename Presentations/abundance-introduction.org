* Abundance Introduction

** Welcome and Introduction
  
Hello! Thank your for the opportunity to share with you today!
This presentation is the first part of an introduction to a big
subject which, when I have to distill it down to one word, I
like to call /Abundance/.

I should say immediately that by /Abundance/ I don't mean
"having lots of stuff". Instead, I'll be introducing you to
/Abundance/ as a powerful and valuable /Context/, /Paradigm/ and
/Culture/. I'll be explaining more fully what I mean by these
three fancy words shortly.

For now, let's just say that
      - /Contexts/ tell us what things mean
      - /Paradigms/ are the Big Contexts for /Cultures/
and together they have a tendency to puppet us and to get in the
way of communicating new ideas.

I'm hoping that this presentation piques your curiosity and that
you will visit my website to learn more about everything I'm
going to present here and links to the sources which I'll be
referencing here.

I'll be introducing myself and my peculiar viewpoint on the
world as we go along. If you want a handle, you can call me
/Touch/ or /Heart-Touch/, names which I was given at /Burning
Man/. If I have a chance, I'll speak about how my experience of
/Burning Man/ has inspired and informed my understanding of
Abundance; otherwise, you'll find that material on my website.

** Sources

I've come to my current understanding of /Abundance/ through a
number of sources. I'd like to acknowledge a few of those right
away. Then I'll share some of what I've learned from a few of
those sources.

- Riane Eisler :: Riane Eisler's distinction of /Partnership
  Culture/ comes very close to what I mean by /Abundance
  Culture/. Her writings have greatly clarified my understanding
  of these matters. I'll be sharing more from her studies
  shortly.
- David Deutsch :: If you're at all a geek like me, I recommend
  that you immediately watch David Deutch's TED Talks and if you
  find them enlightening, read his book /The Beginning of
  Infinity/.
- The Open Culture Movement :: Sharing knowledge and
  understanding is a key source of the richness of the modern
  world. It is being accelerated by new understandings of /Free
  Software/, /Maker Communities/ and much more. A great example
  is /The Internet/, which is based almost entirely on /Open
  Standards/ implemented by /Open Source Free Software/.
- Zen, Taoism, Sufism :: I first discovered these spiritual and
  philosophical traditions in the writings of /Alan Watts/. I
  especially like this quote from the /Sufi/ poet /Rumi/:
 #+begin_quote
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing
and rightdoing there is a field.
Iâ€™ll meet you there.
 #+end_quote
- Burning Man :: If you haven't already experienced Burning Man
  culture, you should (1) set aside anything you've heard, (2)
  visit the /culture/ part of their website which you can find
  by googling "burning man culture".

Okay, this is enough of a list for now - you'll have to read
about my other key sources on my website! I'd like to share more
deeply about what I've learned from a couple of these sources.
